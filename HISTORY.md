The Chaosnet Bridge program was written by Bj√∂rn Victor
(bjorn@victor.se) in 2017-2018, based on earlier code (from 2005) for
pairwise bridging (ether<->chudp, chudp<->unix), where the
Chaos-over-unix-sockets was based on code by Brad Parker
(brad@heeltoe.com, see http://www.unlambda.com/cadr/).

BPF support (for Ethernet on e.g. MacOS) is based on code by Daniel
Seagraves & Barry Silverman (see https://github.com/dseagrav/ld) and
by Ken Harrenstien (see https://github.com/PDP-10/klh10 or
http://klh10.trailing-edge.com/).
