# Configuration

See also the [example configurations](EXAMPLES.md).

## Command line options:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| -d  | turns on debug (lots of it) |
| -v  | turns on verbose (less detail) |
| -t  | turns on TLS debug (lots). Same effect as enabling the `debug` option to `tls`, see below. |
| -c *cf* | reads config from file *cf*, default cbridge.conf |

## Configuration file syntax

`;` or `#` at the **start** of a line begins a comment. Below, *%o* stands for "an octal number", typically 16-bit.

### Global settings

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `chaddr` *%o* | set my default chaos address - must be set |
| `myname` *name* | set my Chaosnet host name, max 32 bytes, for STATUS. Defaults to "real" host name up to first period, first based on Chaosnet DNS name for `chaddr`, then on local host name. |
| `chudp` *portnr* [`dynamic` \| `static` \| `ipv6` \| `debug` off/on ] | set my chudp portnr (default 42042). If "dynamic", add new chudp destinations dynamically when receiving pkts from unknown sources. With ipv6 option, listens to both v4 and v6 (enabled also by defining a chudp link where the host has an ipv6 addr). With debug on, prints some debug stuff. |
| `tls` [ `key` *keyfile* ] [ `cert` *certfile* ] [ `ca-chain` *ca-chain-cert-file* ] [ `myaddr` *%o* ] [ `server` *portnr* ] [ `debug` off/on ] | set up for TLS using the private key in *keyfile*, the cert in *certfile*, and the CA trust chain in *ca-chain-cert-file*. If `server` is specified, a TLS server is started listening to *portnr* (default 42042, if at EOL). TLS servers are always "dynamic" in that they listen to connections from anywhere, but accept only those using certificates trusted by the CA trust chain. Server-end connections are added dynamically at runtime, and can not be pre-declared. The local address is set to the `myaddr` parameter, or the global `chaddr`. With debug on, prints some debug stuff. |
| `ether` [ `debug` off/on ] |  With debug on, prints some debug stuff. (Note that interface names are now on link definitions.) |
| `chip` [ `dynamic` off/on \| `debug` off/on ] | Allow dynamically added destinations (cf `chudp` above). With debug on, prints some debug stuff. |
| `dns` [ `server` 130.238.19.25 ] [ `addrdomain` CH-ADDR.NET ] [ `forwarder` off/on ] [ `trace` off/on ] | set the DNS IP server (which should handle CH records, default above), the domain of "local" CH class addresses (default above, no ending dot), enable/disable forwarding of pkts received on the "DNS" contact name (default off), and enable trace printouts (default off). DNS is used internally by the TLS server/client to look up the certificate CN (of server and client) as Chaos hosts, looking for their addresses. |

### LINKDEF:
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `link` *LINKTYPE* `subnet` *%o* *ROUTEARGS* | configures a subnet (one octal byte) |
| `link` *LINKTYPE* `host` *%o* *ROUTEARGS* | configures an individual host (octal 16-bit address) |

### ROUTEDEF:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `route host` *%o1* `bridge` *%o2* *ROUTEARGS* | configures a route to host *%o1* through the host *%o2* (there had better be a way to reach *%o2* , though a route or link) |
| `route subnet` *%o1* `bridge` *%o2* *ROUTEARGS* | configures a route to subnet *%o1* through the host *%o2* |

### ROUTEARGS (optional):
| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `myaddr` *%o* | defines the address of this bridge on this link (e.g. its address on that subnet) |
| `cost` *c* | sets the cost of the route: direct, ether, asynch. [should support actual numbers too?] |

### LINKTYPE:
| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ether` *ifname* | this is a Chaos-over-Ethernet link using the interface *ifname*. Default type: direct, cost: direct. |
| `unix` | this is a Chaos-over-unix-sockets link. Default type: direct, cost: direct. |
| `chudp` *host:port* | this is a Chaos-over-UDP link to *host* (IPv4, IPv6, or hostname) on *port* (default 42042). Default type: fixed, cost: asynch. |
| `tls` *host:port* | this is a Chaos-over-TLS link, client end, connecting to *host* (ip or name) at *port* (default 42042). Default type: fixed, cost: asynch. |
| `chip` *addr* | this is a Chaos-over-IP link to *addr* (IPv4, IPv6, or hostname). Default type: fixed, cost: asynch. |

Note that while links implicitly define a (static) route to the subnet/host,
you can only have a CHUDP link to a host, not directly to a subnet;
you need an additional route definition for the subnet.
(See the MX-11 [example config](EXAMPLES.md).)

Some link types can only be to hosts (CHUDP, TLS client) and some can only be to subnets (Ether).

Note that when configuring a CHIP subnet link, you should use an
explicit IP/IPv6 address (not a host name), and the last octet should
be zero (0). For subnets, the host byte of the Chaos address is copied
to the last octet of the configured IP/IPv6 address. For IPv4, the
host byte can not be 0xFF, since that would map to the IP subnet
broadcast address.
(IPv6-mapped subnets will not receive routing info until broadcast for IPv6 is implemented.)
(The name `chip` coincides with a parameter to the `chudp` implementation in klh10, which is a tiny bit unfortunate.)

A `link` definition is automatically created when using "dynamic" chudp (or chip)
and a chudp (or chip) pkt arrives from a new source.

A dynamic `route` definition is automatically created when a Chaosnet
routing (RUT) pkt is received, describing a new or better route to a
subnet. 
Dynamic routes are also defined automatically by incoming TLS
connections (to the server) and when using "dynamic" chudp/chip,
unless there is an existing static route.
