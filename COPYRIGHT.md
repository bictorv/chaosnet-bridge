The code is (initially) based on `echaos` (by Björn), and `chudprt` (by Björn, partly based on one of Brad Parker's chaosd clients). Some code from [LambdaDelta](https://github.com/dseagrav/ld) (the LMI Lambda emulator by Daniel Seagraves), and some from [klh10](https://github.com/PDP-10/klh10) (the PDP10 emulator by Ken Harrenstien).
